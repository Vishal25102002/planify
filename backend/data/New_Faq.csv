What is a port-out scam? ,"A port out scam is a type of fraud where a scammer transfers or ports out your phone number to another carrier without your permission. Here's how it typically works: 

The scammer collects personal information about you, such as your name, phone number, address, and possibly other sensitive data like your Social Security Number or account PIN. 

Using this information, the scammer contacts your mobile carrier and requests to transfer your phone number to a different carrier. 

If the scammer provides correct information, the carrier approves the transfer, and your phone number is moved to a new account controlled by the scammer. 

Once the scammer has control of your phone number, they can receive your calls and texts, including any two-factor authentication codes sent to your phone. This can allow them to access your bank accounts, social media, email, and other services.

Can I transfer the credit from my old SIM card when I port in from another network?,"When you port your number from one network to another, the primary purpose is to retain your phone number. However, any remaining credit on your old SIM card or account typically does not transfer.

Key points about credit and number porting
Credit usually doesn't transfer – In most cases, prepaid credit or balance remains tied to the original service provider and cannot be moved to a new network.
Use up your credit – Before initiating the porting process, it's best to use any remaining balance, as it will likely be lost once the transfer is complete.
Check with both providers – Always confirm with both your current and new service provider about their policies on credit transfers or refunds.
Lyca Mobile policy – Lyca Mobile does not facilitate credit transfers or refunds when porting a number.

What is an APN and why is it important? ,"Access Point Name (APN) is essential for your phone to establish a connection to mobile data. It is, in a way, the identity of the mobile carrier. When setting up a new phone or inserting your SIM card for the first time, your network operator ideally sends APN details through a configuration message. These details vary by service provider; additional information about your specific APN can usually be found on the provider's website. 
While modern operating systems have introduced automatic APN configuration, making setup easier for users, there are instances where phones lack this feature or face compatibility issues, requiring manual APN configuration. 
For a seamless experience with Lyca Mobile, follow these recommendations: 
Apple users: To access Lyca Mobile service, ensure your phone is updated to the latest iOS version. After activation, don't forget to enable 5G in your phone's settings. For guidance on checking your current iOS version, click here.
Android users: Ensure your phone is running on the latest operating system to configure the APN settings. Click here for guidance on how to set up APN manually on Android phones.

How can I reduce data usage and avoid overage charges?,"Managing your data usage is essential to prevent unexpected charges. Here are some effective ways to reduce data consumption and stay within your plan limits:

Use Wi-Fi whenever possible
Connect to trusted Wi-Fi networks instead of using mobile data. Wi-Fi is typically faster and does not count against your data plan.

Set data alerts and limits
Most smartphones allow you to set data usage warnings and limits. This helps you track your usage and automatically disable data when you reach a set limit.

Monitor data usage regularly
Check your data usage in your phone’s settings to stay aware of your consumption and make adjustments if needed.

Restrict background data
Some apps continue using data in the background. Disable background data for non-essential apps in your phone’s settings.

Use offline mode
Download music, videos, and other content while on Wi-Fi to use offline later, reducing mobile data usage.

Adjust streaming quality
Streaming high-definition (HD) videos consumes significant data. Lower the video quality in streaming apps like YouTube or Netflix when using mobile data.

Cache maps and content
Apps like Google Maps allow you to download maps for offline use. Doing this while connected to Wi-Fi can save data when navigating.

Restrict app updates
Set your apps to update only over Wi-Fi to avoid automatic downloads using mobile data.

Enable data-saving modes
Many apps and web browsers, such as Chrome, offer a data-saving mode that compresses content before loading it.

Limit social media data use
Auto-playing videos and high-resolution images on social media can quickly consume data. Adjust app settings to minimize unnecessary usage.

Avoid excessive tethering
Using your phone as a hotspot can drain your data rapidly. If tethering is necessary, monitor usage closely.

Consider data add-ons or a higher plan
If you frequently exceed your data limit, check for data add-ons or switch to a plan with a higher allowance.

By being mindful of your data habits and making small adjustments, you can significantly reduce usage and avoid overage charges.",,Yes,"['How can I limit my data usage on Lyca Mobile to avoid extra charges?', 'What steps can I take to reduce my data consumption on Lyca Mobile?', 'How do I track my data usage to prevent overage charges on Lyca Mobile?', 'What are some tips for minimizing data usage on my Lyca Mobile plan?', 'How can I avoid exceeding my data limit on Lyca Mobile?']","['Data usage', 'Lyca Mobile overage', 'Data tracking', 'Reduce consumption', 'Data limit']",Technical Support
